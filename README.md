# html2txt

[html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text) but in Node.

--------

## Installation:

`npm i -g html2txt`

## Usage:

`html2txt someurl`

`html2txt zacanger.com`

`html2txt ~/foo/bar.html`

## Why?

I like the original a lot, but I wanted there to be one in Node.

## Roadmap

* Better opts for `to-markdown`
  * Hopefully including getting rid of the chained `replace`s
